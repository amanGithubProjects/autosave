const textarea = document.getElementById("myTextarea");: This line finds an HTML element with the id "myTextarea" and stores it in a JavaScript variable called textarea. This allows us to work with that textarea element in JavaScript.

function saveToLocalStorage() { ... }: This is a JavaScript function called saveToLocalStorage. Its purpose is to save the content of the textarea to the browser's local storage.

localStorage.setItem("savedText", textarea.value);: Inside the saveToLocalStorage function, this line saves the current text inside the textarea to the browser's local storage under the name "savedText". Local storage is like a small database built into the browser where you can store data.

if (localStorage.getItem("savedText")) { ... }: This checks if there's already some text saved in local storage under the name "savedText".

textarea.value = localStorage.getItem("savedText");: If there's text saved in local storage, this line retrieves it and sets it as the current content of the textarea. So, if you had typed something before and saved it, it will load that text back into the textarea when you revisit the webpage.

textarea.addEventListener("input", saveToLocalStorage);: This line adds an event listener to the textarea. It listens for any input changes, like when you type or edit text in the textarea. When you make changes, it calls the saveToLocalStorage function to save the updated text to local storage.
